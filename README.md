## Introduction

The goal of this project is to gain insights into the survival rates during the Titanic disaster by examining passenger data. Whether you're interested in historical events, data analysis, or machine learning, this repository aims to offer valuable information and visualizations.

## Data Sources

The analysis relies on a dataset from a reputable source:

- [Titanic Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/titanic-dataset) - Description of the dataset containing passenger information, including survival status.



## Analysis

The analysis covers a wide range of aspects, such as:

- Demographic factors (e.g., age, gender, class).
- Ticket details (e.g., fare, embarkation point).
- Correlation between various features and survival outcomes.

The code for the analysis can be found in the [analysis](/analysis) directory.

## Findings: Relationship Between Survival and Various Factors

In this analysis, we explore the intricate relationships between survival outcomes and several key factors among Titanic passengers.

### 1. Survival and Age

- **Visualization:** Utilizing age distributions and survival status visualizations, we explore how age relates to the chances of survival.
 
- **Observations:** Initial findings may reveal patterns, such as a higher survival rate among certain age groups or potential variations in survival based on age.

### 2. Survival and Sex

- **Gender Disparities:** Visualizations and statistical analysis examine the correlation between gender and survival.
 
- **Insights:** Preliminary insights may uncover gender-related trends, potentially revealing variations in survival rates between males and females.

### 3. Survival and PClass (Passenger Class)

- **Class Disparities:** Analyzing survival rates across different passenger classes helps unveil potential class-related patterns.
 
- **Socioeconomic Impact:** Insights into how passenger class correlates with survival provide a glimpse into the socio-economic dynamics during the Titanic disaster.

### 4. Survival and Fare

- **Fare Distribution:** Visualizing fare distributions among survivors and non-survivors offers insights into the relationship between fare paid and survival.
 
- **Impact on Survival:** Analyzing fare-related trends may shed light on whether passengers who paid higher fares had higher chances of survival.

### 5. Survival and SibSp (Number of Siblings/Spouses Aboard)

- **Family Impact:** Examining the survival rates based on the number of siblings/spouses aboard helps understand the impact of family size on survival.
 
- **Insights:** Observations may reveal whether passengers with larger or smaller family groups had better survival chances.

These findings contribute to a comprehensive understanding of the dynamics between survival outcomes and various factors. Explore the detailed visualizations and analysis code in the [findings](/findings) directory for a more comprehensive exploration of these insights.
